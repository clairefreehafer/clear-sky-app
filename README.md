# SkyWatch
SkyWatch is a single-page application with data visualizations representing astronomical observing conditions for the next 24 hours. It utilizes data from ClearDarkSky's [Clear Sky Charts](http://www.cleardarksky.com/csk/), a tool which I have used myself on many occassions. It was originally created using **Bootstrap**, **D3**, and **Google Maps**, but is in the process of being refactored to **React**.
