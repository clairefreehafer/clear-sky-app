# SkyWatch

My project for Grace Hopper Academy's Stackathon. Watch my presentation on the app [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjVmCEl0YxM).

SkyWatch is built on top of Bootstrap's [Greyscale](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/) Template. Given the limited time for the project, I wanted to start off something pre-made.

This project is still very incomplete, and more of a prototype than anything else. I hope to one day refactor it into a big-girl app.

Data is from [cleardarksky.org](https://github.com/joshumax/csk-cli), and special thanks to [csk-cli](https://github.com/joshumax/csk-cli) for how to retrieve said data.
